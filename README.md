Design a Laravel project to accommodate the same feature implemented in assignment 1. In addition,
your Laravel project will apply the following:
1. The form includes sending an automatic email when a new user is registered. The email title is 
“New registered user” and the email content is “A new user <username> is registered to the 
system”.
2. Include one automated test function using Laravel testing.
3. Apply Laravel multi-language feature. Your webpage must support two languages (English is 
necessary). The second language is your choice (we recommend Arabic).
